`# Here is my quickstart stuff

Let's put some quickstart stuff here to remind me how to
fool around with Docker when I haven't touched it for the
past six months.

## another little section

and this section has

* a list
* in it, with
* truly
* meaningless
* contents.

and we have some code

    IF (IT .EQ. 'FORTRAN') THEN PRINT*, 'NOPE' ENDIF
    (eq? it 'Lisp) -> nil
    (it == "C/C++) => 0

I dunno, maybe it's Forth.
